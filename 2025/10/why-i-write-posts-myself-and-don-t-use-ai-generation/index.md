title: Why I write posts myself and don't use AI generation

It can be unexpected to write texts about AI without AI. Let me explain why this is important for me.

First of all, this is not a magazine or a newspaper. These are just my essays about our futuristic days. I don't need to be perfect for anyone else, so I can make mistakes, fix them, study and become better right here, in this blog.

But I need to study. I need to make new thoughts. My thoughts, not AI's, not generated ones. AI can explain them in future. But if I can't think, there's nothing to explain.

I also need to improve my English. English is not my native language, so I can't chat with AI in the best way. English is the hottest new programming language, so I need to speak English well if I want to be the best engineer.

These texts are results of my studying. My way. My history. My work log.

If I ask AI to write it for me I will lose my identity. I don't want to lose it. I would like to save it. My style, my sense of humor, my experience. All of them make a footprint on my texts. All my previous life affects this text. And all of them go away when I generate texts.

So, I use this blog as a diary, but public. I don't expect anybody to read them.

> I am content with few, content with one, content with none at all.
