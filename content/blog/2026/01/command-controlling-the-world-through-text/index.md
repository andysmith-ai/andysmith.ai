Command — controlling the "world" through text.

The idea is to work in a single interface — whether Obsidian, Commacs (a commander based on Emacs), or a custom-built one. The implementation doesn't matter; what matters is the technology itself.

Here's how it works: I make a "move" by writing a message (text, voice, images, documents, facial expressions, etc.). I try to formulate it as completely as possible. A move is a command to change the world. I can only make moves by writing messages.

Then I send the command. The world changes through a chain of agents. How exactly? That's also a question. Most likely, world descriptions change in the form of git repositories, and then the world itself changes through CI. The main thing is that I receive the result of this change. In what form, I don't know yet. Maybe it's a feed of messages, or a dashboard that's always open, perhaps a dashboard with a news feed. Doesn't matter. The interfaces are still in progress. The main thing I receive is a quick and compact reaction of the world to my changes in the form of a description of the new world state.

I draw conclusions (perhaps my command contains errors, inaccuracies, or contradictions, and I'll learn about them through feedback), and make the next move.

So my participation in this game called life comes down to sending commands. Is this the most efficient way? Can I reduce everything to this model, or is it too simplified?

Can Claude Code serve as such a commander?
