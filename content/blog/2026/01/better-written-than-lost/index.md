Originally, I planned to write all my texts myself without using AI. But now I realize this requires considerable—actually, serious—discipline and extra time to polish my style in a non-native language. So I often simply don't find the time, and that's why I don't write on my blog. Not because I have nothing to say.

So I've decided to write however feels comfortable and trust AI to improve and format the text. I'll also keep all the originals, so in the future I can run these same initial drafts through newer, smarter models and get better versions.

For now, I won't overthink whether a post is "unpolished" or "low quality." Better to write it down badly than to lose it entirely.

What do I need to set up a blogging process right now so that publishing a new post takes seconds?
