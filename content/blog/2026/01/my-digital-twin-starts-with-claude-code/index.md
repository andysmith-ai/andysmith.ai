I want to save everything I write in Claude Code. And everything it answers. Everything it does, which tools it calls. Absolutely everything. Then I want to index this information.

After that, I'll analyze it. What did I think about most this week? Where do I make mistakes most often? How can I optimize my work? What connections exist between sessions? What do I constantly overlook?

I can also use this session history in future sessions. This will become my personal context graph — or at least a significant part of it. I'll have to give up using other interfaces, but that's fine, Claude Code is good enough. I'll need to spend some time making it work not just in developer mode.

Actually, I want to digitize everything I do on my computer, save it, and analyze it all. But starting with Claude Code is easiest — it stores data in JSON, which is easy to parse and save to a unified database. I have multiple devices running Claude Code, so this might be a small but solvable problem.

Once I get the key insights, I can expand the schema and connect more sources to my information collection system. Then I'll be able to create my digital twin — one that knows everything I know and uses that data to automate the routine.
