title: Everything should be written

I'm building a habit of writing down everything. I think this is the base of efficient work.

Any thought should be written down. Any bookmark, any interesting book, any link, any quote, any paper should be saved. Everything interesting. But I should save only things which I am really interested in, not all of them. This is important.

Ideas don't appear out of thin air. They are born from other ideas (mine or other people's, but already written down). If so, they should be linked. I can track how my ideas grow and find insights there.

Every step, every hypothesis, and every experiment should be noted. A thought that I think but don't write down is a useless thought.

My notekeeper, the home of my notes -- is a private place. Some people write directly to the public, but I can't. It's my dream to work transparently and think only about things I can share. But not now. I'm too shy. So, I need an always-private space. This is a kind of filter before publishing.

I write my own notes without AI, because my notes should represent my thinking. I use AI for working with my notes, for fact-checking, for spell-checking, for finding insights, for making links between notes, and for something else. But my ideas are only my ideas. I use a special mark for AI-generated text in my notebook.

Ideally, every idea should be public. Every note should be traceable to public posts. This is not necessary, but recommended because public ideas are a public good. My ideas can inspire someone to have new thoughts. This makes progress.

This is why I make blogging the first thing I do every day.
