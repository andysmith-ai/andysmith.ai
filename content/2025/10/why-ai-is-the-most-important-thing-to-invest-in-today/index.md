title: Why AI is the most important thing to invest in today

Let me explain why I think AI is the most important thing I should invest my time and money in.

I mean I should read news about it immediately after I wake up, before any other things. I should invest my time in reviewing new technologies, new models, and new architectural approaches. I should build my new company based on a new era of tools. My employees are not just people now. My staff are AI and people who can work with AI.

The world changed. AI is a fundamental shift. Everything changes. General practices, communication, economics, and politics. Everything works in a new way.

How? I don't know. But I must know, because if I ignore this shift I'll lose everything. I feel like a horse cab driver watching cars get invented. But we are all horse cab drivers now. I need to study all day if I want to win (or not lose at least). I need to try something new every day. I need to understand how to use new tools in my business and use them. Every day I need to change something. I need to build new tools.

So, it's very important to be in this race. And it's so exciting! I need to be ahead.
