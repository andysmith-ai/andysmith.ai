Reading [Cursor's post on dynamic context discovery](https://cursor.com/blog/dynamic-context-discovery).

"Treat terminal as a file" — that's the Emacs way. Both approaches share the same idea: a unified interface to everything through files (or buffers).

It would be fascinating to build an AI agent that works natively with Emacs buffers. You could reduce everything to text and use Emacs for literally everything.

The only problem: Emacs as a user interface for AI is impossible to sell. People won't appreciate the elegance.

One could try to revive Emacs with modern technology while preserving its spirit and philosophy. But it probably won't take off.
