So I'm simplifying the writing process to the maximum, shortening the path from forming an idea in my head to publishing it.

First, I've been using a private Obsidian for personal notes for a long time. In one of my next posts, I'll describe it in more detail (along with the history of updating my note-taking systems, which includes dozens of tools and approaches).

All that's left is to set up the publishing part.

For this, I bought a virtual machine and set up Claude Code on it. The VM only has access to one repository with posts (yes, I'm paranoid and don't let Claude Code onto my personal computer — I think that would be the height of foolishness).

Now I write my posts as usual in my private notes, and when I realize a post is ready to publish, I SSH into the VM and simply paste the text into Claude Code. It prepares the text (I'll add copying of my stylistic quirks later) and pushes to the repo. Very simple.

Actually, this is a very deep idea that eluded me for many years. KISS. Simplify to the max. My whole life I've been overcomplicating things, thinking about non-existent options, thinking about why I shouldn't do something instead of just doing it and seeing what happens.

It's better to do something simple and fast, and redo it tomorrow, than to not do it for years waiting for the perfect moment.
