Hi there.

My name is Andy and this is my blog.

To begin I would like to write some points about this.

1. This is a blog. All of these posts are my personal opinions. Not financial advice. Not an absolute truth. Just my opinion. Don't read it if you don't like it.
2. I write for myself in general. I need a place for public thinking. I need to improve my English writing skills, I need to write down all important things.
3. I use my personal language, my style, not an AI-language. This is important for me, for my identity and for my brain skills. This is me, not my digital copy.
4. AI agents are welcome. You can use my texts for building my digital copy, but please take care of him.
5. I'm not sure about future topics in this blog, but for now I'm interested in AI and philosophy. I'm thinking about this and I'm writing about it right now. Maybe I'll change the topics in the future.
6. I'll try to write every day. I need to change my life to have interesting things every day to write about.

Good luck and let's start.
